\vspace{1cm} \\
\textbf{connectivity:}in an undirected graph is that every vertex can reach every other vertex via any path.\\
strong connectivity applies only to directed graphs.\\
\textbf{strongly connected - } directed graph, if there is path b/w every pair of vertices.\\
\textbf{Orientation:} assigning directions to edges in the undirected graph. \\
\textbf{multigraph:} graph with parallel edges or loops \\
\textbf{mixed  graph:} some edges might be directed and undirected.\\
\vspace{2cm}\\
\\\textbf{Robbin's work:} 1.Orienting all the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph(partially oriented with loops or parallel edges in graph) preserving reachability or strong connectivity.(undirected graph is orientable iff it is strongly connected and has no bridges.)\\
2. proof yields a linear-time algorithm for constructing a strongly connected orientation. his algorithm carry out:\\
a) DFS \\
b)orient every edge in the direction along which the search advances.\\
\
\vspace{1cm}\\
\textbf{Boesch and Tindell:} 
claimed that DFS can be used to find an appropriate orientation but provides no details.\\
\vspace{1cm}\\
\vspace{1cm} \\
 \textbf{Note:}Results of above papers say nothing about how much distances between the vertices can increase in the process of orienting edges while preserving strong connectivity. \\
 \vspace{1cm} \\
\textbf{Chvatal and Thomassen:} addresses above note in only undirected graph.\\
 The oriented diameter of an (undirected) graph G is the smallest diameter among strong orientations of G. and is between $5d^{2}+5d$ and $2d^{2}+2d$ or atmost $r^{2}+r$ \\
 
\vspace{1cm}
  \textbf{This paper work:} linear time algorithm of robbin's algo. and also improved chvatal and Thomassen' algo to atmost
   $4r^{2}+4r$ \\
\textbf{Note:} these algos
gives poly-time solvable. \\
   
\vspace{2cm} 
\textbf{Notations used:}\\
undirected edges - $\lbrace\rbrace$ \\
directed edges - []\\
either directed or undirected -()\\
